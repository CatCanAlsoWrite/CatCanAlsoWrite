## About my progress
#### gap years
During my gap years from 2020 to 2022, I embarked on a **transformative journey of self-discovery**, where I had the opportunity to explore 5 different cities, read over 50 books, write more than 100 essays, try 3 different jobs, learn to play the ukulele, practice French/German/Japanese, paint, and engage in a variety of sports and meditation practices. 

Not only did this enriching experience help me maintain a healthy mind and body, but it also allowed me to **delve deeper into my passions and cultivate new interests**. Through this journey, I gained a newfound appreciation for lifelong learning and personal growth and developed a strong sense of self-awareness and purpose.

#### career shift year
Upon discovering my true passion for technology, I made the decision to **pursue a career as a Full Stack Engineer**. 

To achieve this goal, I **honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. As a testament to my commitment and dedication, I successfully **completed a personal project**, which entailed developing a job hunting website, **with stack of MERN**. 

The entire process was a tremendous learning experience, and I was thrilled to be able to apply my newfound knowledge and skills. I am now more passionate than ever about pursuing a career in this dynamic field and am eager to continue learning and growing as a Full Stack Engineer.
